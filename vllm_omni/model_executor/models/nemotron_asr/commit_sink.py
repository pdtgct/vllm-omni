"""The production composite commit sink (PORT-HOOK-001 as amended).

One bounded, model/worker-owned :class:`CommitSink` implementation:
``reserve`` admits status capacity and optional capture capacity
atomically, pre-commit, and pins the registry lease for the call's
complete ordered bindings; the returned reservation's single
post-commit ``stage`` is no-fail by construction — the status slot was
preallocated (pinned host memory on CUDA) at sink construction, so
staging is one non-blocking device-to-host copy plus reference stores.
The sink exposes only status-clean committed records once the
asynchronous status copy has completed at the normal scheduling
boundary; durable persistence stays outside the model transaction.

Torch + stdlib only: locally testable under the loader chain.
