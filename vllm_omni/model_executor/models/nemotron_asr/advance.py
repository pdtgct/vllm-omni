"""The advance seam split (ledger P5-1; PORT-ADV-001/003).

The legacy ``run_forward_step`` (``forward_step.py``, deleted at
Task 7) was replaced by two narrower operations that separate the
storage-agnostic checkpoint transition from the outer page-pool
transaction:

- :func:`advance_session` — the ONE storage- and adapter-agnostic
  CHUNK transition (PORT-ADV-001). It owns the incremental frontend:
  the caller hands it raw PCM plus validated controls
  (:class:`ChunkBatch`) and gathered checkpoint state
  (:class:`SessionStateBatch`, including the frontend raw/mel tails and
  counters), and it advances the bounded frontend, encoder,
  conditioning, and RNN-T label loop. It never sees a pool, a
  ``state_indices`` tensor, a queue, or a book.
- :func:`advance_model_rows` — the ONE shared outer transaction
  (PORT-ADV-003) every native/fallback/probe caller passes through. It
  receives the scheduler's row mapping (:class:`RowPlan`) — not a
  pre-joined index tensor — so it itself composes decode-then-prefill
  indices, derives freshness from scheduler metadata (never recycled
  page contents), runs whole-call structural preflight (PORT-STATE-007)
  before any resident read, classifies CHUNK/REPLAY/FLUSH,
  gathers-only-for-CHUNK (PORT-STATE-008), calls ``advance_session``,
  materializes/validates captures, and projects the committed
  adapter-neutral :class:`AdvanceResult` through the selected emission
  adapter in one transaction.

Both operations are implemented as of Phase 6c (the four contract
seams — plan provenance, decode resolver, capture reservation, and
the row-status handoff — are the design's §Phase-6c transaction
seams). The former ``forward_step.py`` / ``run_forward_step`` legacy
path and regression oracle was deleted at Task 7, once the model
``forward`` was rewired through :func:`advance_model_rows` and the
five-cadence pod parity gate passed (ledger P5-1 — a semantic split,
never a second legacy forward path).

    CHUNK-only: REPLAY and FLUSH rows never enter this function. It owns
    every stateful checkpoint step — the incremental bounded frontend
    (advancing ``state``'s raw/mel tails and counters from ``batch``'s
    raw samples and controls), encoder-cache advancement, language
    conditioning, predictor advancement, and RNN-T emission ordering —
    so no caller reimplements any of them (PORT-ADV-001). It reads and
    mutates ``state`` in place into the next state and returns the
    adapter-neutral :class:`AdvanceResult`.

    Length-aware (PORT-ADV-004): one call serves one profile+geometry
    bucket carrying mixed session-first / continuing / final /
    zero-frame rows. Every shape is host-derived from the bucket
    geometry (padded frontend width ``C``, matching the reference's
    largest single regular/final cadence shift, and encoder
    width from the subsampling formula); validity is per-row length
    tensors. Every per-row failure — wrong chunk sequence, audio
    after finalization, an envelope geometry different from the
    bucket's, an oversized final residual, or a frontend design
    invariant — is a masked no-op reported as a bit in
    ``AdvanceResult.row_status``; the transaction consumes that
    tensor at its commit readback. The transition never raises on a
    device predicate and never uses a device assertion. The call
    issues no host/device synchronization outside ``decode_fn``.

    Args:
        core: the assembled pipeline (encoder / lid / predictor /
            joint / featurizer).
        batch: raw PCM plus validated controls, one row per CHUNK.
        state: gathered checkpoint state, read and mutated into the
            next state.
        geometry: the bucket's admitted geometry id — a host value,
            per the profile+geometry bucket contract (PORT-PERF-001).
        decode_fn: the RNN-T decode to run — REQUIRED and never
            defaulted here (PORT-DEC-008): ``decode_compact_active``
            (eager, synchronizes on compaction) and
            ``decode_dense_masked`` (fixed-trip, sync-free) stay
            unselected candidates until the measured dense-vs-compact
            profile; startup then builds a dispatch table keyed by
            geometry, padded batch tier, and execution/precision
            profile, and passes the selected callable per bucket.

    Fixed order (design §Phase-6c transaction seams):

    1. compose decode-then-prefill indices from ``plan`` and validate
       every structural row/page property HOST-SIDE before any page
       read (PORT-STATE-007): row count vs ``input_ids``/
       ``inputs_embeds``; non-null (``!= null_block_id``), live,
       in-range (``< num_pool_blocks``) indices; uniqueness;
       speculative-column exclusion (extra decode columns);
       real/padding-row agreement — then upload the validated indices
       asynchronously for the device gathers;
    2. reject unqualified graph coverage, form CHUNK buckets from CPU
       plan authority, order them by earliest deadline, and resolve
       every eager decode before the first resident read;
    3. initialize fresh rows from plan authority without reading
       recycled pages, then gather only continuing rows' required
       session state; evaluate replay echoes
       and the host-role cross-check ON DEVICE into the transaction's
       ``ROW_STATUS_*`` bits (echo mismatch is row-local after
       trusted preflight, PORT-DEC-007 as amended); classify each
       real row CHUNK / REPLAY / FLUSH;
    4. group CHUNK rows by execution profile + immutable geometry
       (host authority: ``plan.is_chunk`` + ``plan.geometry_id``) and
       gather their full frontend/encoder/predictor scratch; valid
       length stays a per-row tensor, not a batch-key component;
       and run :func:`advance_session` with its pre-resolved callable;
    5. validate complete decode results, merge and project them,
       prepare optional candidate records, and validate the complete
       all-bucket scatter plan before one composite reservation;
    6. issue fixed-shape predicated page scatters (failed rows issue
       no store), then perform the reservation's one no-fail combined
       status/candidate stage.

    Suppression (PORT-STATE-008): any structural defect fails the
    whole call before a read; an expected per-row defect resolves to
    a device status bit and a masked park-only no-op. An unexpected
    Python/CUDA compute failure aborts the whole call before scatter;
    a catastrophic device failure during the prevalidated commit is
    worker-fatal, never bucket/row suppression or rollback. No row
    scatters unless its emission result can be returned. Transition
    kernels never mutate resident pages directly.

    Host staging (PORT-PERF-001): ``staging`` is optional reusable
    pinned H2D buffering (:class:`HostStaging`) for the once-per-call
    composed-index, fresh-row, and control vectors; ``None`` keeps
    the un-pooled per-call :func:`_h2d` path (probes/CPU). The
    per-bucket CHUNK row-position vector, staged once per resolved
    bucket inside step 4's loop, also rides ``staging`` when given —
    through :meth:`HostStaging.stage_bucket`, which keeps one
    dedicated buffer PER GEOMETRY. Since each geometry resolves at
    most once per call, no bucket's in-flight copy is overwritten by a
    later bucket, so this is allocation-free without the overwrite
    race a single shared bucket slot would carry; it falls back to
    ``_h2d`` only when ``staging`` is ``None``.

    Returns:
        The runner's row output as projected by ``adapter`` (e.g. the
        ``(N, H)`` decision-carrier for MRV1).

    Raises:
        ValueError: a structural mapping defect, a missing/invalid
            resolver, or a trusted-identity projection-shape defect —
            always before any resident mutation.
