"""The Task-5 plan provider: host row authority for the transaction.

`advance_model_rows` proves that its :class:`RowPlan` columns reproduce
each row's :class:`PreparedRowBinding`; this module is where those
bindings are MINTED truthfully. The model's ``prepare_row_plan_context``
runner hook observes the final host row order (request ids, scheduled
CPU token ids, per-request block ids, and each CHUNK's CPU envelope
header from its request-side multimodal feature) and asks the
:class:`SessionRegistry` to join them
into one immutable, consume-once :class:`PlanContext`; ``forward`` then
combines that context with the attention metadata's host row counts
into the transaction's ``RowPlan`` (design §Phase-6c transaction
seams, PORT-ADV-003 as amended).

Authority boundaries, stated exactly:

- The ENGINE is the authority for row order, decode/prefill counts,
  and block allocation (``CachedRequestState.block_ids`` at the pin).
- The REGISTRY is the authority for session identity across steps:
  admission generation, admitted geometry, the current session-control
  prompt, and block-remap rejection. It is stamped host-side from the
  FIRST minted CHUNK's envelope header — the serving tier's twin
  admission record read on CPU before any device work — and updated
  only by later minted CHUNKs.
- The DEVICE remains the cross-check: every envelope is re-validated
  against the plan authority by the transaction's row-status bits, so
  host/device drift masks rows instead of corrupting sessions.

Registry mutations are atomic per hook call. Prompt transitions remain
provisional until the transaction's status is consumed at the normal
scheduling boundary: a failed row clears the proposal and preserves
the prior admitted prompt, while a clean row publishes it.

Torch + stdlib only (CPU tensors): the whole module runs under the
macOS loader chain and is differentially tested locally.
