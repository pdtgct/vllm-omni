"""Offline weight-conversion verification (PORT-WGT-001/002/003).

The runtime loads standard HF safetensors; this module is the offline
tool's core: a declarative mapping from checkpoint tensor names to the
port's module tree, enforced by a consume-exactly-once ledger with
post-transform shape checks. Any mismatch is a hard failure carrying a
named tensor-level diff — never warn-and-proceed. Missing LID weights
(``prompt_kernel``) are fatal for this model id: language conditioning
is part of the contract, the model never degrades to unconditioned
transcription (PORT-WGT-003).

The concrete rule table for the shipped checkpoint is data, filled in
against the real safetensors index at P2 bring-up; the enforcement
machinery here is what the GPU-free tests pin.
