"""The exact bounded incremental frontend (design §Exact Bounded Frontend).

An incremental implementation of the checkpoint's whole-utterance
pre-emphasis and centered STFT (``MelFeaturizer``): it retains only a
bounded raw-sample tail and the committed-boundary mel tail, and on
each CHUNK commits exactly the mel frames whose effective STFT window
is stable given the samples received — proven equal to the
whole-prefix featurizer by differential tests (``test_frontend.py``,
local: this module imports only ``torch``).

Frame geometry (hop 160, ``n_fft`` 512, center=True, constant pad):
frame ``k`` of the whole-signal STFT covers preemphasized samples
``[k*160 - 256, k*160 + 256)``; a frame is STABLE once sample
``k*160 + 255`` exists, i.e. ``k < (N - 256)//160 + 1`` for ``N``
received samples. The final tail instead commits all
``output_lengths(N) = N // 160`` frames, with positions at or past
``N`` contributing zeros — exactly the whole-signal mask + constant
pad. Pre-emphasis continuity costs one extra retained sample
(``y[t] = x[t] - p*x[t-1]``); an absent sample (index < 0) is zero,
which also reproduces ``y[0] = x[0]``.

Batching: one call serves one profile+geometry bucket and carries
mixed session-first / continuing / final / zero-frame rows — the
committed frame count is a per-row tensor, never a batch-shape
property. Every shape is host-derived (``pad_frames``, the raw-tail
capacity); no tensor value determines a shape, so the call issues NO
host/device synchronization (PORT-PERF-001/PORT-ADV-004).

Every per-row failure — protocol (caller-set sequence/geometry/
oversize bits, the frontend's own finalization state) and design
invariant (margin, target order, pad/retention overflow, negative
samples) — resolves to one bit of a device-resident int32 status; a
row with any bit set mutates nothing and commits nothing (a safe
masked no-op), and the transaction consumes the status at its commit
readback (PORT-STATE-008 tiers). The transition never raises on a
device predicate and never uses a device-side assertion: a fired CUDA
assert corrupts the context, converting one row's defect into the
loss of every resident session.

The frontend counters live in the ``(B, 8)`` int64 tensor whose slot
names/order are pinned by ``manifests.FRONTEND_COUNTER_FIELDS``; the
``CTR_*`` indices below mirror that tuple (cross-pinned by test).

    Boundary-capped (the option-(d) resolution, ledger 2026-07-17):
    each row commits mel frames only through its cumulative cadence
    target (``cadence_boundary`` for regular chunks, derived by the
    caller from the admitted geometry and chunk sequence), never
    through every currently stable frame — stability yields a uniform
    6-frame margin over the ``kC-7`` boundary, and the mel tail is
    retained relative to the TARGET so the encoder's pre-encode cache
    always holds the frames before its actual boundary. Frames stable
    beyond the target stay in the raw tail and recompute identically
    on a later update (exactness is preserved). A final tail ignores
    ``target_frames`` and commits through ``final_frames`` under the
    separate residual rules.

    Length-aware (PORT-ADV-004): rows commit PER-ROW counts — mixed
    session-first / continuing / final / zero-frame rows share one
    call. The returned mel tensor has the fixed host-derived width
    ``pad_frames`` (the bucket bound is ``C + 6``, design §Exact
    Bounded Frontend — a legal final residual is strictly under one
    cadence per PORT-SESS-001/003); columns at or past a row's count
    are exactly zero. Failure handling is the ``ROW_STATUS_*``
    bitmask: the caller's incoming protocol bits are AND-composed
    with the frontend-owned FINALIZED predicate and the
    design-invariant predicates, and any row with a set bit mutates
    nothing and commits nothing — a safe masked no-op, never a raise
    or a device assertion. No tensor value determines a shape and no
    host/device synchronization occurs.

            ``forward``).

        valid_samples: ``(B,)`` true sample counts.
        final_tail: ``(B,)`` bool final-tail markers.
        target_frames: ``(B,)`` long cumulative cadence targets

        mel_tail: ``(B, n_mels, MEL_TAIL_FRAMES)`` committed-boundary
            mel tail, updated in place.
        counters: ``(B, 8)`` int64 counters, updated in place.
        pad_frames: host-derived padded output width; a row whose
            commit would exceed it takes ROW_STATUS_PAD_OVERFLOW and
