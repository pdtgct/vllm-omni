"""NVTX phase ranges for the streaming transaction (PORT-OBS).

A profile can only be compared to another profile if the spans carry the
same names, so the phase names live here as a closed set rather than at
each call site. They are the names the profiling-record schema and the
evidence card expect (``port.<phase>``); renaming one breaks comparison
with every prior digest and is a reviewed change, like renaming a metric.

Instrumentation on a hot path has to be free when it is off. At the
target operating point the transaction runs ~12,500 times a second, so a
disabled phase must cost one attribute load and one predictable branch:
no generator, no context-manager allocation, no string work. Both the
enabled and disabled objects are preallocated once per name at import.
