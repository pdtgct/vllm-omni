"""Startup decode dispatch-table generation (PORT-DEC-008).

Consumes a ``p6b_decode_profile`` artifact and COMPUTES per-bucket
decode selections under the versioned dispatch-calibration policy —
never eyeballed brackets (decisions/decode-dispatch-regime.md r3.2):

- lanes come from the artifact's ``generator_eligible_lanes`` — a
  correctness-unqualified lane never produces entries;
- compact may be selected only from SELECTIVE cells (policy realized
  within tolerance) and only when it beats the sync-free arm by the
  recorded hysteresis at EVERY dcp activity level (the worst-case
  objective); a nonselective or missing level forces the sync-free
  arm;
- an unmeasured tier resolves to the nearest measured tier, and to
  the sync-free arm when the bracketing tiers disagree (the
  crossover-gap rule — dense's worst case is bounded overcompute,
  compact's adds syncs, host stalls, and capture-ineligibility);
- an execution profile whose engine graph covers decode never
  dispatches the capture-ineligible candidate (sanity invariant, not
  a measured outcome);
- the table carries the measurement fingerprint (device, driver,
  torch, model-shape digest — deliberately CHECKPOINT-independent)
  and a runtime mismatch fails closed for performance-gated
  deployments.

Pure host logic: no torch, importable anywhere. The consumer is
``advance_model_rows``, which resolves the callable per
profile+geometry bucket at batch-composition time.
