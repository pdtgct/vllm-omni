"""Atomic directory publication (PORT-WGT-004).

A published checkpoint directory must never be observable half-written:
``publish.py`` builds the complete artifact in a fresh sibling staging
directory and only then swaps it into place. A failure while building
leaves an existing destination byte-identical and removes the staging
directory; the destination is touched only after every file write has
succeeded.

STDLIB ONLY — testable locally by file-path load (``test_staging.py``),
like ``manifests.py``.

    ``build`` receives the empty staging directory and must write the
    COMPLETE artifact into it. If it raises, the staging directory is
    removed and ``out_dir`` (existing or absent) is untouched. On
    success the previous ``out_dir`` (if any) is renamed aside, the
    staging directory is renamed into place, and the old artifact is
    deleted — same-filesystem renames, so no reader ever sees a
    partial ``out_dir``.

        build: writes the complete artifact into the staging directory
